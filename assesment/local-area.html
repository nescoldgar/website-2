            <hr class="hr-width-50">
            <p class="roboto-regular">Melrose's agricultural heritage dates back to at least the Roman era, though it is during the early medieval period that it began to gain prominence. 
                The foundation of Melrose Abbey in 1136 by King David I marked a significant turning point in the town's development.  
                
                By the 16th and 17th centuries, Melrose and the surrounding Borders region had become famous for its sheep farming. 
                The Tweed Valley's lush meadows were well-suited to raising sheep, and the wool produced here became a highly sought-after commodity. 
                The introduction of the Border Collie dog in the 19th century further revolutionized sheep farming by aiding in the herding of large flocks across the rugged terrain.
                                
                <p class="roboto-regular">The region’s farming community faced various challenges, including periodic crop failures, the impact of harsh winters, and, in more recent times, changing agricultural 
                policies and practices. However, the people of Melrose have continually adapted, embracing innovations in farming techniques and sustainable practices. 
                This resilience is still evident in the region’s modern farming community, which combines traditional practices with newer agricultural technologies.
                
                <p class="roboto-regular">   
                Today, Melrose remains closely linked to farming, with a strong emphasis on sheep farming, beef production, and cereal crops. The town hosts the famous
                Melrose Agricultural Show, celebrating local farming traditions and showcasing the skills of local farmers.</p>
